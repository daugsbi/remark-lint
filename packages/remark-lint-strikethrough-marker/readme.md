Warn for violating strikethrough markers.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'~'`, or `'~~'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used strikethrough style and warns when
subsequent strikethrough use different styles.

## Fix

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is not included in any default preset

When configured with `'~'`.

###### In

```markdown
~foo~
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

When configured with `'~'`.

###### In

```markdown
~~foo~~
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:6: Strikethrough should use `~` as a marker
```

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'~~'`.

###### In

```markdown
~~foo~~
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:6: Strikethrough should use `~~` as a marker
```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-strikethrough-marker
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-strikethrough-marker",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-strikethrough-marker readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-strikethrough-marker'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
